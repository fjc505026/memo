####file link in Linux
soft(aqua): like short cut in windows, if orignal file has been delete, the soft linked file can not be open
hard: through inode, need delete orignal file and the hard linked file, data will be sync both at the two files, but the two files needs in the same file system and can not apply on directory

### ln
default is hard link
soft link: -s, --symbolic              make symbolic links instead of hard links

example:
gcc hello.c -o hello
ln hello hello_hard
ln hello hello_soft (please use absolute path if in different folder)
ll -i hello*
the inode number of hello and hello1 are the same

copy soft linked file:
cp -d hello_soft  (absolute path?)
