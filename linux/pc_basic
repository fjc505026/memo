PC hardware:

CPU: core, hyper threading
main memeory: DRAM,DDR, SDRAM
Graphic card: PCI,PCIe3.0 x 4,8,16

DISK: HDD,SSD
Ethernet, USB,BIOS(ROM) ,CMOS 

CMOS: 	record the setting in main board, like sys time, CPU vdds, freq, I/O addr,IRQ

PC software:

Kernel (OS): provide hardware driver,TCP/IC network. The implmentation of Kernel various betwween hardware arch tect, e.g Windows can run on X86, but not on ARM
*manage hardware resource, like CPU, memeory, I/O device and file system
*system call interface
*process control
*memory management
*filesystem management
*device drivers

System call: provide open interface for development, it is a layer between Kernel and software
